Well, well, let's get started!<br>The software was designed to be as simple as it can be for a beginner, so you won't gave up too early! Let me explain the most basic things!<br>In the main windows, you can see the <b>Syntax List</b>, these are the only things you need to work with!<br><br>The software generates an HTML file and <b>injects the CSS</b> into it, the only thing you will find in your folder is the <i>'img'</i> that contains the images you used. Because I don't want you to lose your images, Boo-T <b>will copy them</b> to that folder and changes the path in the HTML file if you are using an absolute path like <i>'C:/Documents/powerpuffgirls.png'</i>.<br>")

bootrow(id=basics, rate(auto), opacity=0.70, article(artitle="I. Basics", title-align=left, rawtext="In the syntax of Boo-T, there are <b>commands</b> and <b>arguments</b>. Commands are the most important, they are at the beginning of lines, they are followed by rounded brackets. The line is always ended by a deliminator, which also separates code and comments, you can write anything after the deliminator till the next newline. So the syntax basically looks like this:<br><br><b><u>command</u></b>(<i>arguments</i>) <i>deliminator</i> comment<br><br>Setting the <b>deliminator</b> is really special compared to the other commands. You can set it only in the very first line of your code (other ones will be ignored), writing '<b><u>deliminator</u></b>' without the rounded brackets you would usually use with commands and putting the desired deliminator <b>after a single space.</b><br>Most commands are only needed to be used once (except for bootrows and tables), the newer ones are just overriding the older ones.<br><b>Arguments</b> are seperated by commas inside the rounded brackets. There are three kind of appearances of arguments:<br><ul><li>Just a single word</il><li>Two words splitted by an equality symbol, like <i>arg=something</i></li><li>A word with rounded brackets, like commands, containing several words seperared by commas, like <i>arg(something,something,something)</i></li></ul>Because of this wrapping you can place spaces and newlines nearly anywhere, so your code can be really easy to read, like I did with the banner for this site:<br><br>banner(size=cover, height=450, animation(50s,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E:/PyCharm/P/Boo-T/Spooky1.jpg,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E:/PyCharm/P/Boo-T/Spooky2.jpg,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E:/PyCharm/P/Boo-T/Spooky3.jpg,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E:/PyCharm/P/Boo-T/Spooky4.jpg),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text('Hel for Boo-Ting!', 4em, center)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) %%<br><br>")) hullahopp
